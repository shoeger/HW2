<h2 class="titletop"> About Sam </h2>
	<p>
		I grew up in the small town of Dyersville, IA. Dyersville is the home of The Field of Dreams. I have an older sister, Alissa, and younger sister, Kim. 
		We were raised by our two wonderful parents, Dave and Jane. Growing up in Dyersville is where I found my love for soccer, basketball, football, and golf.
		At a early age I knew my life was going to surround around sports. I started playing on a traveling basketball team and golfing in events around the state.
		By the time high school came around my family moved to a small town 10 minutes east of Dyersville called Farley, which is where my parents still reside today. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I attended Western Dubuque High School where my dad happened to be the Principal. In high school I excelled in basketball and golf and earned a total of four state 
		tournament berths. I was also involved in Future Business Leaders of America, FBLA. My senior year I won an event at the state level and earned a trip to Nationals
		in Orlando, FL. During high school I found my first job at Timberline Golf Course being a Pro Shop assistant. This was a perfect fit for me because I was able
		to golf for free throughout high school. After high school I chose to take my talents to the University of Iowa to get and education. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I am currently a junior in the Tippie College of Business earning an undergrad degree in BAIS. I started working at the ITS Help Desk when I was a freshman and now
		I work in the Health Care Information Systems Department at the University of Iowa Hospitals. During my free time I enjoy playing pick-up basketball games, spending nights on the town 
		with friends, drinking craft beer, and trying to cook. That latter is a new passion of mine that is challenging, but I would like to think I am improving. 
		Before I graduate I would like to travel across Europe and experience the different cultures that it has to offer. After college I plan on putting on my big boy pants, find
		myself a honey, and keep on living life.
